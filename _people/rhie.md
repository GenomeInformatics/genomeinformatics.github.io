bio: Arang received a BS in computer science in 2009 and MS in bioinformatics in 2011 from Ewha Womans University. She completed her PhD in 2017 at the Genome Medicine Institute, Department of Biomedical Science, Seoul National University College of Medicine. Her dissertation research aimed to build the first high-quality Korean reference genome for use in medical diagnostics. Her role in this project was to develop new computational methods to accurately phase each haplotype of the genome. Currently she is a visiting fellow in the Genome Informatics Section at NIH/NHGRI, where her research continues to focus on the reconstruction of true haplotypes from long-read sequencing and other emerging technologies.
