bio: Jeff earned his PhD from the New York University School of Medicine. His thesis, conducted in the laboratory of Deborah Yelon, explored the cell fate and patterning of lateral plate mesoderm, an embryonic tissue that gives rise to the heart and other structures. As a postdoctoral fellow in Elaine Ostrander’s group (National Human Genome Research Institute), he studied the genetics of canine skull shape and body size. In 2013, Jeff took up an academic post in The Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh). He continues to explore the genetic basis of companion and production animal traits and diseases with an emphasis on skeletal morphology. In addition, he led efforts to produce a genome assembly of a Labrador retriever (“ROS_Cfam_1.0”). As a visiting scientist in the Phillippy group, he is spearheading efforts to assemble and annotate telomere-to-telomere dog genome references.
