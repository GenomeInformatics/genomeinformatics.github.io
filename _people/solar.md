bio: Steven earned his B.S. from Johns Hopkins University with majors in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Before starting at the NIH, he interned as a software engineer at Google and Tesla, worked to build a device for partial-thickness corneal transplants with Treyetech, and performed genomics research at JHU with Dr. Ben Langmead, investigating the use of lifting aligned reads from GRCh38 to CHM13 to predict alignment accuracy. He is excited to develop new tools and methods to improve assembly, sequence analysis, and all things genomics, and is drawn to the potential for patient impact of this work. He plans to pursue MD or MD/PhD programs after his time with the NHGRI.
