bio: When Nancy earned her PhD in physical chemistry at Stanford University back in 1995, her thesis research proposed theories for reactions involving just a handful of atoms, but in 1996, she made a change to studying DNA and has never looked back since. Focusing on the detection and characterization of genomic variation in populations, Nancy has worked at the National Human Genome Research Institute since 2002. She has been a member of the Genome Informatics Section since 2022, where she works on the process of polishing diploid assemblies to near perfection.
