bio: Ann graduated top of her class with a BSc in Genetics and Cell Biology in 2012 from Dublin City University, Ireland. She then received a national IRCSET scholarship to carry out a PhD in Bioinformatics and Molecular Evolution which she completed in 2012. This focused on using mathmatical networks to uncover novel gene transcripts across primate species. From there Ann went on to carry out a two year Postdoctoral Fellow position with Genomics Aotearoa in Auckland, New Zealand. Here, Ann worked on generating high quality genomes for endemic, and endangered vertebrate and invertebrate species. Currently she is a visiting fellow in the Genome Informatics Section at NIH/NHGRI where she works on understanding the "dark matter" of the human genome and how genome structure has evolved.
