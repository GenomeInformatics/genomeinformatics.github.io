bio: Ann graduated top of her class with a BSc in Genetics and Cell Biology in 2012 from Dublin City University, Ireland. She then received a national IRCSET scholarship to carry out a PhD in Bioinformatics and Molecular Evolution which she completed in 2012. This focused on using mathmatical networks to uncover novel gene transcripts across primate species. From here, Ann went on to carry out a two year Postdoctoral Fellow position with 'Genomics Aotearoa' in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Here, she worked on building pipelines for the generation of high quality genomes for endemic, and endangered vertebrate and invertebrate species that were respectful to the tradtional and cultural practices and knowledge systems of Māori. Currently, she is a Visiting Fellow in the Genome Informatics Section at NIH/NHGRI where she works on building inclusive, scalable genomics infrastructures  alongside Sámi, Māori, and Native American colleagues. She is also a co-organiser of IndigiData (https://indigidata.nativebio.org/), and has led workshops for both SING Aotearoa and SING USA (https://www.singconsortium.org/).
