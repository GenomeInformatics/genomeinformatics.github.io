bio: Adam is the director of the Center for Genomics and Data Science research and head of the Genome Informatics Section at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). His lab develops efficient methods for analyzing DNA sequencing data, including tools for genome assembly, comparative genomics, clustering, forensics, and metagenomics. He is a co-founder of the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, and the Vertebrate Genomes Project, which, together, seek to enable the complete and gapless assembly of human and vertebrate genomes. He is a recipient of the U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, the NIH Director’s Award, the Ilchun Molecular Medicine Award from the Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and a distinguished alumni award from Loyola University Maryland. He was named by TIME magazine as one of the world’s most influential people of 2022 for his work on completing the human genome, and is currently working to understand the function, evolution, and clinical relevance of the approximately 10% of the human genome newly uncovered by the T2T project.
