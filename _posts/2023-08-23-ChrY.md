Our latest paper, with the self-explanatory title [The complete sequence of a Y chromosome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y), is now published! If you do not have a Nature subscription, here is a [free-to-read link](https://rdcu.be/dkd9j). This complete Y chromosome marks the final human chromosome to be finished from telomere to telomere, and its sequence has been incorporated into the CHM13v2 reference genome, which now includes the complete sequence of all 24 human chromosomes. The complete sequence and associated analysis resources can be found on the [CHM13 GitHub repo](https://github.com/marbl/chm13). Congrats to the entire T2T team on completing this highly repetitive chromosome that was once considered "unassemblable"!
