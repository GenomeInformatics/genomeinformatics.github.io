Our latest paper with Tim Smith (USDA) is now out in [Nature Biotechnology](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4277) --- "Complex allelic variation hampers the assembly of haplotype-resolved sequences from diploid genomes. We developed trio binning, an approach that simplifies haplotype assembly by resolving allelic variation before assembly ... Trio binning uses short reads from two parental genomes to first partition long reads from an offspring into haplotype-specific sets. Each haplotype is then assembled independently, resulting in a complete diploid reconstruction." Here are links to the [full paper](https://rdcu.be/9Pi4) and a nice [summary from NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/27571730/2018-news-feature-new-technique-promising-for-a-more-accurate-genome-sequence/) with quotes from me and Tim. Credit to [Sergey Koren](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/people/koren/) and [Arang Rhie](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/people/rhie/) for developing this great new method. We have many more trios planned!
