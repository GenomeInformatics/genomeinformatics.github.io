Today we published the _complete_ "T2T" genomes of 6 ape species: chimp, bonobo, gorilla, Sumatran orangutan, Bornean orangutan, and siamang gibbon. This landmark resource is the result of a long-running collaboration (5 years of work!) led by myself, Kateryna Makova, and Evan Eichler. The genomes and our initial analyses are now presented in two papers: [Complete sequencing of ape genomes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08816-3) published today, and [The complete sequence and comparative analysis of ape sex chromosomes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07473-2) published last spring. There is a tremendous amount of data, code, etc. that goes along with this project, which we have organized on the [T2T-primates project page](https://github.com/marbl/Primates). Don't miss the [T2T Browser Hub](https://github.com/marbl/T2T-Browser) which presents all of this data as browser tracks, including expression, methylation, gene annotation, repeat annotation, etc. Comparing these genomes to our own furthers our understanding of human biology and genetic disease, including what makes us uniquely human, and brings us one step closer to understanding the language of the genome. I am excited to see what new discoveries will arise from these genomes!
