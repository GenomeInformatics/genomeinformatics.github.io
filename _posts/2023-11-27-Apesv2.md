Last year we released complete, gapless, "T2T" sex chromosomes for chimp, bonobo, gorilla, Sumatran orangutan, Bornean orangutan, and siamang gibbon. This December we are proud to announce our latest preprint ["The Complete Sequence and Comparative Analysis of Ape Sex Chromosomes"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.30.569198v1)! Over the past year, we have also finished the autosomes for these genomes! The v2.0 assemblies for these species are now available from our [T2T-primates project page](https://github.com/marbl/Primates), and all of the raw HiFi, ONT, Hi-C, and Illumina sequencing data can be found on [GenomeArk](https://www.genomeark.org/t2t-all/). This has been a Herculean effort involving nearly everyone in the lab and a large swath of the T2T team. It turns out that finishing six genomes is a lot more work than finishing one! A huge thank you to everyone involved, especially Kateryna Makova for spearheading the project.
