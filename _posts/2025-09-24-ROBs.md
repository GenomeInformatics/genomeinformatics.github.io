ðŸš‚ The T2T train keeps rolling. Our latest work investigating the structure and cause of Robertsonian chromosomes with the Gerton and Garrison labs [is out today in the journal Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09540-8)!  What's a Robertsonian chromosome and why do they matter? More info below the break...

<!--excerpt-->

Let Jen explain the basics in [this great video](youtu.be/JmlY5omxQVc) put out by the Stowers Institute press team. You can also find more backstory on this project in the [Stowers Institute press release](https://www.stowers.org/news/stowers-scientists-identify-the-fusion-point-of-robertsonian-chromosomes-hinting-at-how-chromosomes-evolve).

Big congrats to the whole team including Leonardo Gomes de Lima, Andrea Guarracino, Sergey Koren, Tamara Potapova, multiple members of the Genome Informatics Section, the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, and of course Erik Garrison, Jen Gerton, and their respective labs.

To top it off, here is an article from the Washington Post science section featuring Jen looking at some clear liquid in a tube! ðŸ§ª [A genetic anomaly linked to infertility was a puzzle. Scientists solved it.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/09/24/genetic-anomaly-infertility-robertsonian-translocation-chromosome/)
