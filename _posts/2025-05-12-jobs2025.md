Join our team and contribute to the development of complete, personalized “telomere-to-telomere” (T2T) genome assemblies and the analysis of previously inaccessible regions of the genome! We are currently accepting applications for postbaccalaureate and postdoctoral researchers within our lab at the NIH.

<!--excerpt-->

 These positions are under the supervision of [Dr. Adam Phillippy](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Adam-M-Phillippy-PhD), whose [research section](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/) develops and applies computational methods for the analysis of massive genomics datasets with a focus on genome sequencing and comparative genomics. Dr. Phillippy and team are leaders in the field of genome assembly and sequence analysis who have developed many widely used bioinformatics tools (e.g., [MUMmer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC395750/), [Mash](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915045/), [Canu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411767/), [Verkko](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10427740/)), finished the first [truly complete sequence of a human genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9186530/), and recently completed [T2T reference genomes for the great apes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11168930/).

The section is seeking applicants with an interest in developing and/or applying computational methods for genome assembly, sequence alignment, variant detection, variant annotation, and information visualization. Current projects include efforts to sequence and explore all corners of the human pangenome ([Human Pangenome Project](https://humanpangenome.org/)) and enable personalized genomics for the diagnosis of genetic diseases through collaborations with the [Undiagnosed Disease Program](https://www.genome.gov/Current-NHGRI-Clinical-Studies/Undiagnosed-Diseases-Program-UDN) and others.

Perform research at the forefront of genomics in an exciting and supportive environment. Postdocs in the [Genome Informatics Section](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/) are supported for up to 5 years and have wide latitude to carry out their own research vision. Postbacs are typically 2-year appointments with more direct supervision. These positions are entirely focused on research and are meant to equip trainees for the next step in their careers. We are best suited to mentor computational genomics researchers with overlapping interests to our own. You can find a list of our publications via Dr. Phillippy’s [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PTTAqsgAAAAJ&hl=en) page. Postdoctoral stipends start around $70k per year and include family health insurance at no additional cost. Postbac stipends start around $40k per year. International postdocs are sponsored for a J-1 visa (while postbacs must be US citizens or permanent residents). More information on the NIH postdoc program is available from the [NIH Office of Intramural Training and Education](https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/).

**To apply:** Interested applicants should submit their CV, a brief statement of interest, and the names of three references to: adam.phillippy@nih.gov

These are in-person positions. The NHGRI Intramural Research Program is located on NIH's main campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and offers a wide array of training and collaboration opportunities, including access to extensive high-performance computing resources ([BioWulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/)), the NIH intramural sequencing center ([NISC](https://www.nisc.nih.gov/)), and the NIH Clinical Center.
