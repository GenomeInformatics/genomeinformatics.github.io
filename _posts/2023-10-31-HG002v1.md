Today, we are excited to release the [v1.0 T2T assembly of the HG002 benchmark genome](https://github.com/marbl/hg002)! This assembly is part of what we have dubbed the "Q100" project, or in other words, our quest to assemble a completely error-free human genome (in the Phred QV scale, Q100 equates to an error rate of 1 per 10 billion bases). The Genome in a Bottle consortium has released some tremendous resources over the years, including DNA reference materials such as HG002. However, these reference materials are currently defined as a list of variants called against the GRCh38 reference genome. A more natural representation is the complete sequence of the genome itself, i.e. a "genome benchmark" as opposed to a "variant benchmark". This is our first step towards creating such a genome benchmark. We will have much more to say about this in the coming year, but for now you can find more information at the GitHub page linked above.
