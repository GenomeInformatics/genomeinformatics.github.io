Join our team and contribute to the development of complete, personalized “telomere-to-telomere” (T2T) genome assemblies and the analysis of previously inaccessible regions of the genome. We are currently accepting applications for **center coordinator, bioinformatics engineer/scientist, and postdoctoral researcher**.

<!--excerpt-->

 These positions are under the supervision of center director [Dr. Adam Phillippy](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Adam-M-Phillippy-PhD), whose [lab](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/) develops and applies computational methods for the analysis of massive genomics datasets with a focus on genome sequencing and comparative genomics. Dr. Phillippy and team are leaders in the field of genome assembly and sequence analysis who have developed many widely used bioinformatics tools (e.g. [MUMmer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC395750/), [Mash](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915045/), [Canu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411767/), [Verkko](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10427740/)), finished the first [truly complete sequence of a human genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9186530/), and recently completed [T2T reference genomes for the great apes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11168930/).

The section is seeking applicants with an interest in developing and/or applying computational methods for genome assembly, sequence alignment, variant detection, variant annotation, and information visualization. Current projects include efforts to sequence and explore all corners of the human pangenome ([Human Pangenome Project](https://humanpangenome.org/)), complete the genomes of diverse vertebrate species ([Vertebrate Genomes Project](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/)), and enable personalized genomics for the diagnosis of genetic diseases through collaborations with the [Undiagnosed Disease Program](https://www.genome.gov/Current-NHGRI-Clinical-Studies/Undiagnosed-Diseases-Program-UDN) and others.
Available positions include:

1. **Center Coordinator.** Help build the future of data science at NHGRI! This position will be responsible for coordinating research and outreach activities across the newly established [Center for Genomics and Data Science Research](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Intramural-Research/Center-for-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Research). Duties will include the organization of bioinformatics conferences and other community-engagement activities aimed towards growing the profile of genomic data science at the NIH, as well as providing administrative support for members of the center and our associated research consortia (e.g. [T2T Consortium](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup)). There will be additional opportunities to participate in center's research. Past experience in genomics research and large-scale data management is preferred, but applications from all education levels from BS to PhDs are encouraged. Strong organizational and English skills are a requirement, along with an eagerness to help and enthusiasm for genomic data science! Salary commensurate with experience, roughly in the range of $80–130k.

2. **Bioinformatics Engineer/Scientist.** Enjoy the fun of bioinformatics methods development in a low-stress and highly collaborative environment. This position will support algorithm and software development within the [Genome Informatics Section](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/), primarily working with [Dr. Sergey Koren](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Sergey-Koren-PhD) and the genome assembly team that has developed Canu and Verkko. A [list of software](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/projects/) currently supported by the section is available on our homepage. Previous experience in bioinformatics, especially the problem of genome assembly is preferred, but there is no minimum education requirement. PhD applicants will be considered for the position of Bioinformatics Scientist. Very strong programming and analytical skills are a requirement. Salary commensurate with experience, roughly in the range of $100–150k.

3. **Postdoctoral Researcher.** Perform research at the forefront of genomics in an exciting and supportive environment. Postdocs in the [Genome Informatics Section](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/) supervised by Dr. Phillippy are supported for up to 7 years and have wide latitude to carry out their own research vision. This position is focused entirely on research and is meant to build independence and equip the trainee for the next step in their career. We are best suited to mentor computational genomics researchers with overlapping interests to our own. You can find a list of our publications on our [lab homepage](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/publications/) or via Dr. Phillippy’s [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PTTAqsgAAAAJ&hl=en) page. Postdoctoral stipends start between $67–77k per year and include family health insurance at no additional cost. International postdocs are sponsored for a J-1 visa. More information on the NIH postdoc program is available from the [NIH Office of Intramural Training and Education](https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/pd/).

**To apply:** Interested applicants should submit their CV, a brief statement of interest, and the names of three references to: adam.phillippy@nih.gov

The NHGRI Intramural Research Program is located on NIH's main campus in Bethesda, Maryland and offers a wide array of training and collaboration opportunities. These are in-person positions with flexible hours and an option for telework once a week. Funding is stable and includes access to extensive high-performance computing resources ([BioWulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/)), the NIH intramural sequencing center ([NISC](https://www.nisc.nih.gov/)), NHGRI core facilities, and the NIH Clinical Center.

*The NIH is dedicated to building a diverse community in its training and employment programs.*
